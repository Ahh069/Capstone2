This website is about a bakery.
On the page you have the name of the Bakery Sweet Treats.
Place an order has a link to a form where you can fill out the information. This is not working but you can see it is submitting in the system but the user should not be seeing this.

Cake university has a video linked to a Youtube. to show you how to get started baking.
Contact Us will direct you to a contact us form.
Baking products will take you to Amazon for a baking starter pack.

The Header has a link for Register and Login and it is logging the information but again it is not working properly. 

In the future I do plan on creating a react form with my views in the backend to oall connect together.
